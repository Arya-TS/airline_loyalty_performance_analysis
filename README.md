✈️ Airline Loyalty Program Performance Dashboard (Power BI)
📌 Project Overview

This project presents an insight-driven analysis of an airline’s loyalty program using Power BI.
The objective was to evaluate customer engagement, flight activity, and revenue contribution to identify key drivers of loyalty performance and business growth opportunities.

The dashboard is designed to deliver immediate insights without requiring slicer interaction, while still supporting dynamic filtering for deeper analysis.

🎯 Business Objective

The dashboard answers the following key business questions:

Which customer segments contribute the most revenue?

How does flight activity correlate with loyalty status?

Are high-tier loyalty members driving proportional value?

What patterns exist in customer engagement and retention indicators?

This analysis supports data-driven decisions in customer retention strategy, reward optimization, and revenue forecasting.

📊 Dataset Information

Source: Free sample dataset from Maven Analytics

Dataset Name: Airline Loyalty Program

Includes customer-level information such as:

Loyalty tier

Enrollment type

Flight activity

Revenue metrics

Demographic attributes

The dataset was cleaned and modeled in Power BI using relational data modeling principles.

🔍 Key Insights

A disproportionate share of total revenue is concentrated within higher loyalty tiers, but not all high-tier members demonstrate high flight frequency.

Certain enrollment channels contribute more long-term value than others.

Revenue contribution is not strictly proportional to customer volume across segments.

Loyalty engagement varies significantly across demographic and regional breakdowns.

These findings suggest potential optimization opportunities in tier benefits and targeted engagement strategies.
